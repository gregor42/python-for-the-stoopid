IDLE.. it is called IDLE... it is not "***IDEA***"

*That* is something else entirely...  ::slaps-own-face::

PyDev on Eclipse.  That's the one.

I find my chouces are constrained severely by the fact that I'm running Snow Leopard.  It is amazing how long a Windows or Linux build will remain viable & supported ***even by Apple*** but an aging OS/X rev bearer can basically go eat shit.  :sigh: 

But I'm off-topic right?  meh

Zarquon's-see-through-sandals IDLE is a piece of rubbish!

I can see why it exists - from a purely *academic* point of view - pun intended.  You want students to work with such basic crap that they outgrow it almost instantly..  But wow - talk about painful!

The code completion is so slow (on a modern multi-core desktop) as to be completely unusable.

I have opted for a purpose-built EasyEclipse IDE which seems to behave a bit more reasonably - but then am I just more comfortable because I have used Eclipse before?  I doubt others would find it so familiar nor inviting.

Why do developer tools have to look like such budget store garbage?  Don't we have any sense of pride?

There needs to be more Monty Python references.

I don't *care* if you think it is a "generational thing" - that's **bollocks**.  

I love all kinds of stuff from previous generations.  Do I *get* 100% of the content?  No & It doesn't matter.  

The 80/20 rule applies.

I don't *remember* the naming conventions - so I'm going to try to look around & see what everyone else is doing again
I do however grok namespaces - at least in the large grain.

Once again, like everything else in the language, the approach to it strikes me as extremely *relaxed*.

I have been writing a lot of tiny scripts to try things out as I go.

I have to keep stopping myself from putting a semicolon at the end of each line.  It still feels wrong.

So SQLLite is included in Python since 2.5?  SRSLY?

Welcome to Cargo Cult Programming 101



And you know.. for a book called "Learning Python" I'm starting Chapter 3 and I have only run one **Hello, World** program..?

I have been digging into *Learning Python* - the book & the persuit.

As usual, I chafe against the language bigotry and the mudslinging but everyone needs to justify themselves & part of that
is always going to be distinguishing yourself from others in the form of Strongly Held and venomously defended Beliefs.

Also, predictably I am still *bugging out* a little bit about the loose nautre of things.  Stuff that only a Java programmer
could possibly care about.

But the point here is specifically to *learn*.  So I check myself.

And learn I have.

Today I discovered <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/">"PEP"'s</a> - Pyhton Enhancement Proposals.

I read <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8 - The Style Guide for Python code</a>.

As someone whom has been writing code for >3 decades it seemed like a good next step in terms of being able to 
read & write code properly.  I really wanted to know what the Naming Conventions are.

It was very enlightening & made parsing this unfamiliar code much less intimidating.

I have also gone back to poking at <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> on my iOS devices and it really is great stuff!  It is helping me learn much faster than I would otherwise.

So the first thing that I have learned of note is that Python has a package management tool called pip.

I used it & it was far less painful, cryptic & verbose than CPAN...

I also learned that No - you do not have to use tabs.  I used my standard 2 space convention & it worked just fine...

*However* it is worth noting that cutting & pasting text can be a real bummer if your text editor doesn't play nicely.

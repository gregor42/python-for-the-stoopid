I know perl &amp; java - not Python - but you gotta start somewhere; join me in my idiotic baby-steps to usefulness

Today I discovered <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/">"PEP"'s</a> - Pyhton Enhancement Proposals.

I read <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8 - The Style Guide for Python code</a>.

As someone whom has been writing code for >3 decades it seemed like a good next step in terms of being able to 
read & write code properly.  I really wanted to know what the Naming Conventions are.

It was very enlightening & made parsing this unfamiliar code much less intimidating.

I have also gone back to poking at <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> on my iOS devices and it really is great stuff!  It is helping me learn much faster than I would otherwise.

So the first thing that I have learned of note is that Python has a package management tool called pip.

I used it & it was far less painful, cryptic & verbose than CPAN...

I also learned that No - you do not have to use tabs.  I used my standard 2 space convention & it worked just fine...

*However* it is worth noting that cutting & pasting text can be a real bummer if your text editor doesn't play nicely.

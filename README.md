I know perl &amp; java - not Python - but you gotta start somewhere; join me in my idiotic baby-steps to usefulness

I don't *remember* the naming conventions - so I'm going to try to look around & see what everyone else is doing again
I do however grok namespaces - at least in the large grain.

Once again, like everything else in the language, the approach to it strikes me as extremely *relaxed*.

I have been writing a lot of tiny scripts to try things out as I go.

I have to keep stopping myself from putting a semicolon at the end of each line.  It still feels wrong.

So SQLLite is included in Python since 2.5?  SRSLY?

Welcome to Cargo Cult Programming 101



And you know.. for a book called "Learning Python" I'm starting Chapter 3 and I have only run one **Hello, World** program..?

I have been digging into *Learning Python* - the book & the persuit.

As usual, I chafe against the language bigotry and the mudslinging but everyone needs to justify themselves & part of that
is always going to be distinguishing yourself from others in the form of Strongly Held and venomously defended Beliefs.

Also, predictably I am still *bugging out* a little bit about the loose nautre of things.  Stuff that only a Java programmer
could possibly care about.

But the point here is specifically to *learn*.  So I check myself.

And learn I have.

Today I discovered <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/">"PEP"'s</a> - Pyhton Enhancement Proposals.

I read <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8 - The Style Guide for Python code</a>.

As someone whom has been writing code for >3 decades it seemed like a good next step in terms of being able to 
read & write code properly.  I really wanted to know what the Naming Conventions are.

It was very enlightening & made parsing this unfamiliar code much less intimidating.

I have also gone back to poking at <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> on my iOS devices and it really is great stuff!  It is helping me learn much faster than I would otherwise.

So the first thing that I have learned of note is that Python has a package management tool called pip.

I used it & it was far less painful, cryptic & verbose than CPAN...

I also learned that No - you do not have to use tabs.  I used my standard 2 space convention & it worked just fine...

*However* it is worth noting that cutting & pasting text can be a real bummer if your text editor doesn't play nicely.

======================

I know perl &amp; java - not Python - but you gotta start somewhere; join me in my idiotic baby-steps to usefulness

So the first thing that I have learned of note is that Python has a package management tool called pip.

I used it & it was far less painful, cryptic & verbose than CPAN...

I also learned that No - you do not have to use tabs.  I used my standard 2 space convention & it worked just fine...

*However* it is worth noting that cutting & pasting text can be a real bummer if your text editor doesn't play nicely.
